title: Crowd Pattern Analysis
---

{% assign abstract="We propose the <b>very first</b> semantic-level crowd evaluation  metric  in  this  paper. Crowd simulation has been an active and important area for several decades. However, only  recently has there been an increased focus on evaluating the fidelity of the results with respect to real-world situations. The focus to date has been on analyzing the properties of low-level features such as pedestrian trajectories, or global features such as crowd densities. We propose the first approach based on finding  <b>semantic information</b> represented by latent <b>Path Patterns</b> in both real and simulated data  in order to analyze and compare them. Unsupervised clustering by non-parametric Bayesian inference is used to learn the patterns, which themselves provide a rich visualization of the crowd's behaviors. To this end, we present a new Stochastic Variational Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (<b>SV-DHDP</b>) model. The fidelity of the patterns is then computed with respect to a reference, thus allowing the outputs of different algorithms to be compared with each other and/or with real data accordingly. Detailed evaluations and comparisons with existing metrics show that our method is a good alternative for comparing crowd data at a different level and also works with more types of data, holds fewer assumptions and is more robust to noises." %}
