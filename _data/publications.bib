abstract = {Trapped lee waves, and resultant turbulent rotors downstream, present a hazard for aviation and land-based transport. Though high-resolution numerical weather prediction models can represent such phenomena, there is currently no simple and reliable automated method for detecting the extent and characteristics of these waves in model output. Spectral transform methods have traditionally been used to detect and characterise regions of wave activity in model and observational data; however, these methods can be slow and have their limitations. Machine-learning (ML) techniques offer a new and potentially fruitful method of tackling this problem. We demonstrate that a deep-learning model can be trained to accurately recognise and label coherent regions of lee waves from vertical velocity data on a single level from a high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Using transfer learning, wave characteristics (wavelength, orientation, and amplitude) can be extracted from the trained segmentation model. The use of synthetic wave fields with prescribed wave characteristics makes this transfer learning possible without the need to characterise real complex wave fields. Addition of noise to the synthetic data makes the models more robust when applied to more complex and noisy NWP data. The collection of trained models produced provides a valuable tool to investigate the prevalence and nature of lee wave activity, as well as a new way for forecasters to detect resolved waves. The deep-learning model was more capable and quicker at detecting and characterising lee waves than a spectral technique was. This work is just one example of how already established ML techniques can be used to detect and characterise complex weather phenomena from NWP model output and observational data, and how the careful use of synthetic data can reduce the requirements for large volumes of hand-labelled training data for ML models.}

ABSTRACT = {Disruptive change in urban landscapes, such as large-scale tree planting, is complicated by the different priorities of the wide range of urban stakeholders. Here, we demonstrate an approach to the planning of urban green spaces using virtual reality simulations. We evaluate the health benefits (restorative benefits) and safety concerns of participants using virtual reconstructions of 10 urban parks in Bradford, UK, to simulate changes in woodland cover. Participants experienced each of the 10 parks as immersive environments with each of three scenarios: (i) no trees, (ii) real tree distribution, and (iii) doubling of tree numbers. Participants answered a short questionnaire while in each virtual park to quantify their feelings of safety and the restorative benefit that they thought they would experience. The results show that our VR approach produces reported restorative benefits that are not significantly different from those reported in the physical parks during visits by participants. We then demonstrate that increased tree cover is associated with significant increases in perceived restorative benefit, with some evidence of saturation at higher tree densities. Reductions in tree cover lead to a reduction in reported restorative benefit. We suggest that immersive technologies present a useful tool for the consultation and co-design of urban landscapes.},
